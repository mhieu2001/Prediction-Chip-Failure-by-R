Codebook for semi_conductor quality-control data from a semi-conductor manufacturing process. There are hundreds of diagnostic sensors along the production line, measuring various inputs and outputs in the process.


The dataset contains the following variables:

FAIL : a binary variable on whether the chip was a failure (failure: 1; otherwise 0)

SIG1, SIG2, â€¦ , SIG200 : 200 vector of diagnostic signals.
